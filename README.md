# SnapshotJS - Website Screencapture Tool

SnapshotJS is a Vue.js full stack web application which allows users to input a URL
to any website, and it will generate a screenshot of the website.

## Features
- Works with most Vue.js, React.js, and Angular.js SPA sites.
- Works with most lazy-loaded sites (ex: www.latimes.com).
- Works in full screen (viewport) or full page mode screenshots.
- Multiple sizes to choose from (this also determines the full page mode's width dimension).
- Currently exports as a .jpeg file since .jpeg is smaller and no transparency is needed for such websites.
If you need a .png export, you'll have to find a tool online to convert the .jpeg to .png.
